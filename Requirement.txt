To develop a project management tool that fulfills the requirements outlined in TASK 5, here are the key functionalities you would typically implement:

Use authorization mechanisms to ensure users can only access their own projects and tasks.
Project Management:

Create Projects: Allow users to create new projects.
List Projects: Display a list of projects that a user is involved in.
Update Projects: Enable users to update project details such as name, description, and status.
Delete Projects: Provide functionality to delete projects (with confirmation prompts).
Task Management:

Create Tasks: Within each project, users should be able to create tasks.
List Tasks: Display tasks associated with each project.
Update Tasks: Allow users to update task details including name, description, assignees, deadline, and status (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed).
Delete Tasks: Provide functionality to delete tasks (with confirmation prompts).
Task Assignments:

Assign Tasks: Allow users to assign tasks to specific team members or assignees.
Track Assignees: Display assigned users for each task.
Deadline Management:

Set Deadlines: Provide a way to set deadlines for tasks and projects.
Display Deadlines: Clearly display deadlines for each task and project.
Progress Tracking:

Task Status: Track the status of each task (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).
Project Status: Optionally track overall project progress or milestones.
Search and Filter:

Allow users to search for specific projects or tasks.
Provide filtering options (e.g., by status, deadline) to quickly find relevant information.
Notifications:

Implement notifications for task assignments, deadline approaching, or task updates.
Provide a way for users to manage notification preferences.
Reporting:

Generate reports on project/task status, deadlines, and progress.
Optionally, include graphical representations (charts, graphs) for better visualization.
User Interface (UI) Considerations:

Design a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.
Ensure responsiveness for various devices (desktop, tablets, mobile).
